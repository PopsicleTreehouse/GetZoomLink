# Get Zoom Link

`GetZoomLink` is a Python script that prints the zoom links into terminal, based on the current day and provided links.

## Usage

If you don't already have it installed,
download and install python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Open terminal if you're on mac or linux, cmd if on windows
type this into the command line:

    cd src
    python3 GetZoomLink.py

Some configuration is necessary:
if yearly schedule changes,
then you need to update dates.json manually.
If the minimum day is only applicable to grades under or above,
you need to update dates.json manually.

Note that this is likely going to be patched in the future
